The first weekend I created the Unreal repo, and got started porting a Unity system I had made over to Unreal. The system I'm referring to is a basic one that behaves similar to the Sims moodlet system. If you haven't played the Sims before, or just need a refresher, the moodlet system takes in a bunch of needs for a character (hunger, sleep, bladder, etc) and handles them ticking down and tells the character when to go satisfy that need. The hardest step in making this happen is character navigation. The character needs to know they are hungry, then be able to navigate to the fridge to eat. At the end of the first weekend I was able to get characters to navigate, but then the first of Unreal's many bugs crept up. I had characters who navigated to a marked location, animated and faced the correct direction during walking. After finishing the navigation, Unreal got in a loop where it would compile the game, I would press play and it would crash. Oddly, I could comment my code out, compile, uncomment my code, and then compile again and it would play but nothing would happen. It was behaving very strange to say the least. I eventually had to call it, and close out week 2 on a sour note. I have struggled finding significant time during the week to work on this project, so when the next weekend started I went back to work."}),(0,n.jsx)("p",{className:"mt-6 font-light max-w-[1024px] ml-2 mr-2",children:"I managed to google the correct set of keyword to find a potential solution.

For whatever reason the animations stopped working, but I'm not too worried about the look so far, so went on without it. After that I began working on a system to get moodlets in the game, and have then tick down every frame, depending on how much time has passed. It's fairly simple, but works and is easy to adjust in the future for having different needs tick down at different rates. Once the needs were ticking down at a good rate, I created a system to allow characters to execute actions. Actions are things a character may want to do, such as go eat or go to bed. Actions are made up of steps that need to happen to have an action be completed. An example of an action is go eat, which consists of the steps walk to fridge, and wait for hunger meter to fill. Currently, if a character doesn't have an action then a new one is generated if the algorithm can create one. For now it just looks if a need is below 20 percent and assigns an action to increase it if so. In the future actions will consist of more than just need meeting, but for now its a good start. Another possibility with this system is that actions can be queued, which helps with characters interacting with other characters and allows for the possibility for players to queue actions for characters later. While this isn't the path I'm aiming for, a hands off approach may not work later and I'm going to give myself the wiggle room to change my mind later.

I have the needs/moodlets accessible from the editor and you can see as they tick down. When bladder reaches 20 percent the character approaches the toilet and bladder need begins to increase. Next the hunger meter dips below 20 and the character goes to the fridge, and finally the sleep need goes below and 20 and he approaches the bed.
